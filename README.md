### What I Learned

Well I actually learn a lot about how to write a good `README.md`, than the project itself. But, I'm gonna write every technique that I did when building this project.

#### CSS Shorthand Properties

I recommend to always use shorthand property everytime you have a chance to do it. Because...

> Using a shorthand property, you can write more concise (and often more readable) style sheets, saving time and energy.

From [MDN | CSS Shorthand Property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties)

It saves your priceless time and energy! But, it is a little bit tricky. I recommend that only use shorthand properties, like `font`, `padding`, `background`, `margin`, etc, for things that will consistent on any condition. In this case, the *repetition* and the *position* of the background will always be the same. But, the `background-image` will change on desktop screen size. So, what I did...

```css
body {
  /* The position and repetition will always be the same,
     no matter how big or small the 
     user screen size. */
  background: 
    top left no-repeat, 
    bottom right no-repeat;
  /* While the image url will be changed
     on certain size. */
  background-image: 
    url("../images/bg-pattern-top-mobile.svg"), 
    url("../images/bg-pattern-bottom-mobile.svg");
}

@media screen and (min-width: 37.5em) {
  body {
    /* Used desktop bg-pattern */
    background-image: 
      url("../images/bg-pattern-top-desktop.svg"), 
      url("../images/bg-pattern-bottom-desktop.svg");
  }
}
```

This way, you only need to write the new `background-image` inside the `@media` query.

#### Support Query

> The @supports CSS at-rule lets you specify declarations that depend on a browser's support for one or more specific CSS features. This is called a feature query. The rule may be placed at the top level of your code or nested inside any other conditional group at-rule.

From [MDN | @supports - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@supports)

It's simply, let us give fallback by specifying another CSS property that gets more support by most browsers or the opposite. For example, I want to use `gap` property on flexbox layout. But, unfortunately the [Mi Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mi.globalbrowser) doesn't support `gap` property and `@support` query.

I had checked [Can I Use for `gap` property](https://caniuse.com/?search=gap) for the flexbox layout, it gets **86.5%**, which in my opinion it's already get supported well.

![Can I Use website report for gap property](./images/caniuse-gap.jpg)

But, let say I care all the users that use Mi Browser and other browsers that don't support `gap` property.

```css
/**
* 1. If the browser doesn't support the 
*    "@support" query or the property inside the
*    support query then, it will apply 
*    this styling.
*/

.rating__stars {
  display: flex;
}
/* If the browser support the "gap" 
   property, then use it */
@supports (gap: 0.5rem) {
  .rating__stars {
    gap: 0.5rem; /* 1 */
  }
}

.rating__star:not(:first-child) {
  margin-left: 0.5rem; /* 1 */
}

/* If the browser support the gap 
   property then, I don't need 
   "margin-left" for the star that is 
   not the first child of the 
   .rating__stars. */
@supports (gap: 0.5rem) {
  .rating__star:not(:first-child) {
    margin-left: 0;
  }
}
```

#### Cumulative Layout Shift

Have you ever go to a website and then you want to click something and suddenly... the button \*keep moving\* down? It's usually because the ads or images that causing it. This is where `width` and `height` properties is coming to play.

> Always include `width` and `height` size attributes on your images and video elements... This approach ensures that the browser can allocate the correct amount of space in the document while the image is loading.

From [Web Dev | Optimize Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/optimize-cls/)

By using `width` and `height` property, it will prevent the shifting layout from happening. üëç

![Good CLS](./gif/good-cls.gif)

*It creates a **placeholder** before the image is fully loaded*

Also don't worry about the `width` and `height` property will override the external styling. They won't do that. It's also will scale automatically based on its *aspect ratio*.

- [Github Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) - If I forget about markdown syntax, then this is a file that I often refer to.
- [Flexbox Malven](https://flexbox.malven.co/) - If one day, I forget about flexbox, then this is a great reminder.
- [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/) - It helped me to know whether or not that CSS property has been widely supported.

## Acknowledgements

For this `README.md` file I got inspiration from @jubeatt\'s [README.md file on Sunnyside-agency-landing-page repo](https://github.com/jubeatt/Sunnyside-agency-landing-page#readme). It is a nice and informative `README.md`. For those of you who are doing the [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef), I recommend to read that to get some tips on doing the challenge.

### Banner

- For the banner image, I used [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).
- The doodle image on the banner is coming from [Open Doodles website](https://opendoodles.com/).
- For the programming logos on the banner, they're coming from [Devicon](https://devicon.dev/) for the HTML and CSS logo. For the Sass I used the Sass logo from the [Sass official website](https://sass-lang.com/styleguide/brand).
