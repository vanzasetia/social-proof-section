## The Story When Doing This Challenge
I used my [color picker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gmikhail.colorpicker) and got this color `rgb(250, 250, 250)` for the body background color.

### Body Background
This was so hard. So, I used CSS pseudo elements for the top and bottom background. I used absolute positioning and it worked!

But for the bottom one I couldn't make it *full width*, like the gradient (the top one), so I just created with the half width. The reason for it because, even after I applied `overflow-x: hidden` on the `body`, It's still causing a horizontal scroll bar appeared.

When it came to a moment where I need to make it responsive, it's scary. After several times trying to us`clamp()` and `calc()`, which are [CSS Math Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Functions). I didn't make it using those functions üòû.

Ultimately, I ended up with the *normal* way of doing that by setting up media queries to change the size of the background for "every screen size" üòÖ.

### Person
The `person` part I used flexbox to control the layout. I used `svg` for the chevron left and three dots icons.

### Chat
I noticed that the first chat was different. On the mobile it said, *That sounds great. I‚Äôd be happy to discuss more.*, while on the desktop it said, *That sounds great. I‚Äôd be happy with that.* I decided to follow the desktop version.

For the chat layout, I used flexbox for everything started from chat bubble to input message.

### Animation
For the animations, I will do it on my second try.

## What I Learned
* I learned to create illustration using HTML and CSS.
* I learned a little bit about `clamp()` and `calc()`.

## Built With
This project created using **HTML5**, **CSS3**, and **Sass**. I used flexbox to handle every layout.

## Continued development
I will take people feedback and improve this solution. Also, I will try to add animations and try to use `calc()` or `clamp()` for my second try, in the future.
